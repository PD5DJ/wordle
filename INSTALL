Requirements:
LinBPQ
bash
curl
Internet (port 443) for curl to use

Install:
Place wordle.sh wherever you put your LinBPQ external applications and chmod it to be executable.

Edit your bpq32.cfg application interface section like so:

   APPLICATION 10,WORDLE,C 10 HOST 6 K S

Keeping in mind your application, port and command port numbers will likely be different.

Edit your /etc/inetd.conf like so:

   wordle          stream  tcp     nowait  doug    /home/doug/games/wordle/wordle.sh

Make sure the path to wordle.sh is of course correct for your install.

Edit your /etc/services like so:

   wordle          63006/tcp

The port number here may be different for your install (it should match what you used in bpq32.cfg).
